Fragment for M2E Core UI 
This extends M2E Core UI with commands related to Phases and Goals.

## Show Phases and Goals

Select a Maven project in the IDE and then invoke `Project > Show Phases and Goals` command. It shows all the phases and goals in a checkbox tree dialog. Use the `Lob All` command to print the tree into the Maven Console. You can also run the selected goals using the `Launch selected goals` command.
